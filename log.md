# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 1, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I restarted [Angela Yu's 100 Days of Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/). I learned about printing, variables, and the input function. I created a band name generator.

**Thoughts:** I'm familiar with all these functions, but it was nice to review them again and create a simple program.

### Day 2: Jan 2, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I continued day 2 of Angela Yu's 100 Days of Python class. I went over data types and type casting. I also learned some HTML.

**Thoughts**: It was fun to review some of the stuff I already knew and solve solve challenges with them. I Twas a good review even though I knew most of the information aready. I also had a lot of fun playing around with HTML. I usually forget HTML attributes and elements, but I think it's finally sticking in my brain.
