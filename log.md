# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 1, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I restarted [Angela Yu's 100 Days of Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/). I learned about printing, variables, and the input function. I created a band name generator.

**Thoughts:** I'm familiar with all these functions, but it was nice to review them again and create a simple program.

### Day 2: Jan 2, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I continued day 2 of Angela Yu's 100 Days of Python class. I went over data types and type casting. I also learned some HTML.

**Thoughts**: It was fun to review some of the stuff I already knew and solve solve challenges with them. I Twas a good review even though I knew most of the information aready. I also had a lot of fun playing around with HTML. I usually forget HTML attributes and elements, but I think it's finally sticking in my brain.

### Day 3: Jan 3, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I continued Day 3 of 100 Days of Python. Today I learned about if statements. Using this, I created a Treasure Hunting game, I also starting about CSS and HTML classes.

**Thoughts**: Once again, this was all review and the challenges were quite straight forward. It was nice to redo the challenges though, and approach them with additional knowledge so that I could solve them in a simpler way. It was also fun to be creative and write a story for the Treasure Island game. I also had a lot of fun with CSS. HTML classes answered my question about how to make same elements with different styles so it was cool to finally have the question answered!

### Day 4: Jan 4, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I did Day 4 of 100 Days of Python. I learned about the random module and lists in Python. I created a Rock, Paper, Scissors game. I also learned more CSS. I have also been using Git to push all the updates of my log.

**Thoughts**: While some of the Python stuff is good review, it's also kind of boring as I learned it before and I'm familiar with the concepts... I'm debating if I should jump ahead or continue reviewing. CSS is fun so far and I'm excited to continue learning. Git was a hassle to setup on Day 1 as this is a forked repo but since fixing that issue, it's been simple. I used Git in my previous work position but it was a struggle to remember the right commands. Using Git for the past few days has really familiarized me with it.
