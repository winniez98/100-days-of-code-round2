# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 1, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I restarted [Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/). I learned about printing, variables, and the input function. I created a band name generator.

**Thoughts:** I'm familiar with all these functions, but it was nice to review them again and create a simple program.
